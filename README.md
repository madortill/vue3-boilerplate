## Boilerplate Instructions - read before start coding
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.  
This is a boilerplate created by the command "npm init vue".

**IMPORTANT! Before first upload - change <REPO_NAME> in `./vite.config.js` to your repository name.**  
**Also, go to settings -> pages and change "deploy from branch" to Github "Actions"** 


*Project Setup - before the first run:* run npm install  
*run for development purposes:* npm run dev  
*Linting (arranging the code):* npm run lint

**Tips I found while working:ðŸ¤©**
- Start every static assets' url with "@" (equivalent to src directory), so the assets will appear as they should in final site.
